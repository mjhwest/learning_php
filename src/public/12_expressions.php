<?php
//EXPRESIONS 
//expression are anything that has a value or evaluates to a value 
//php is an expression-oritened language where almost everything is an expression. 
 
//the simplets expression are constants, variables and literal values,  
//for example when you assign a value to  variable something like x=5 
//5 is a literal value that evaluates to itself and therefor is an expression 
//if you assign variable x to a variable y; in this case variable x evaluates to 5 and therefore this is an expression .




//another example of expression is when you are comparing one variable to another,
//eg z = x = y 



$x = 5; 
$y = $x; 
if ($x <5) {
    echo 'Hello';
}
