//Match was recently introduced in php8 and will not working in previous versions.

$paymentStatusDisplay = match ($paymentStatus) {
1 => print 'Paid',  
2,3  => print 'Payment Declined', //using the comma between 2,3 is the same as case 2 and 3 (line 12 and 13). its the same as an OR condition. 
0 => print 'Pending Payment',
                                        //provide key value pairs within {}. Where key is the sinhle conditional expression and value is the return expression.

echo $paymentStatusDisplay;

//match expression actually is an expression and it evaluates to a value and therefore can be assigned to a variable. 
// a difference between switch and match is with match you DO NOT need to have the break. 
//match expression is exhaustive, meaning that you have to specify all possible cases, if you dont you will get an error. 
//match does strict comparison whereas switch does lose comparision.
